Steps to upgrade TVO packages to Yoga release from 4.2 GA / 4.2 HF
============================================================================

1. Download the hf_upgrade.sh script to your TVO appliance.
2. Make sure that it is having executable permissions. If not then apply executable permissions.
	chmod +x ./hf_upgrade.sh
3. hf_upgrade.sh having command line options as, 
	--downloadonly | -d  (It will only download the package and extract it in current folder)
	--installonly  | -i  (It will install the package available in current directory. If machine is not on network then copy required package "offline_pkgs.tar.gz" in the current directory)
	--all 	       | -a  (It will download and install the package on the current TVO appliance.)

Example:
	1. Customer wants to download the package only to copy it to some other machine. 
		./hf_upgrade.sh --downloadonly
		./hf_upgrade.sh -d

	2. Customer wants to install the package which is copied / downloaded on the TVO appliance.
		./hf_upgrade.sh --installonly
		./hf_upgrade.sh -i

	3. Customer is having network (internet connection) and wants to download + Install the upgrade package.
		./hf_upgrade.sh --all
		./hf_upgrade.sh -a


Note:
While running hf_upgrade.sh script in offline mode. We need to change the BRANCH_NAME inside hf_upgrade.sh script to download the package from correct location.

For end customer usage set BRANCH_NAME="triliodata-4-2" inside hf_upgade.sh script.
For internal testing in trilio lab, set BRANCH_NAME as fury repo instead of 'triliodata-4-2' inside hf_upgrade.sh script.
